			<p id="animal-description-paragraph" ">Gray wolves range in color from grizzled gray or black to all-white. As the ancestor of the domestic dog, the gray wolf resembles German shepherds or malamutes. Though they once nearly disappeared from the lower 48 United States, today wolves have returned to the Great Lakes, northern Rockies and Southwestern United States.</p>
